🎓 Graduation Project: Machine Learning Model & API
This repository contains the code and resources for our Graduation Project (2023), which integrates a simple machine learning model with a RESTful API. The project demonstrates end-to-end functionality, from developing the ML model to deploying it on a server and integrating it into a mobile application.

🚀 Project Overview
Machine Learning Model:

Developed and trained a simple ML model.
Saved the model using the joblib format for efficient deployment.
API Development:

Built a RESTful API using Flask.
Supported POST requests to interact with the model for predictions.
Mobile App Integration:

The API was successfully utilized in a mobile app as part of the final project stage.
Deployment:

Deployed the API using Render, ensuring a stable and accessible environment for the mobile application.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Machine Learning: Model training and saving using Python.
Flask: Lightweight framework for building the RESTful API.
joblib: Model serialization and deserialization.
Render: Cloud platform used for deployment.

📱 Mobile App Integration
The API was integrated into a mobile application during the final stage of the project, providing seamless interaction between the app and the machine learning model.

🏆 Team Leadership
This project was led by Mahmoud Mohamed Rady, who served as the Team Lead (Project Manager) and AI Engineer. The project was completed successfully as part of our graduation requirements.

🌐 Deployment
The API was deployed using Render, a reliable cloud platform, to ensure scalability and accessibility for the mobile application.
